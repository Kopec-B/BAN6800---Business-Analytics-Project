Telco Customer Churn Prediction: Data Preparation and Model Development
Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn in a telecom company using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The dataset was cleaned, preprocessed, and prepared for model development. This README provides an overview of the preprocessing steps, analysis techniques, and modeling process.

Dataset
Source: Telco Customer Churn Dataset

Dataset Features:
Customer demographics (e.g., gender, age).
Services subscribed (e.g., Internet, Phone).
Account information (e.g., tenure, payment method).
Target variable: Churn (indicating whether the customer left or stayed).
Preprocessing Steps
1. Handling Categorical Variables:
Columns such as gender, MultipleLines, OnlineSecurity, etc., were label-encoded to convert categorical data into numeric representations.
2. Boolean Conversion:
Boolean features were converted to numeric for compatibility during scaling.
3. Standardization:
All numeric columns were normalized using StandardScaler to ensure consistent feature scaling.
4. Output Dataset:
The processed dataset is saved as optimized_telco_customer_churn.csv.
Modeling Workflow
The following steps will be used to develop the predictive model:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify key drivers of churn and visualize correlations.
Feature Selection: Determine the most impactful variables for churn prediction.
Model Development: Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest).
Evaluation: Measure model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.
